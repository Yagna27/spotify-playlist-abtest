Dataset Summary:
- Mood Playlists: 1373
- Genre Playlists: 1290
- Total Tracks Analyzed: 138,474
- Final Playlists after Cleaning: 2,321
- Engagement Metric: Average Track Popularity per Playlist
- Additional Metrics: Track Count, Avg Duration

Track Count Stats:
- Mood: Mean = 61.53, Std = 29.83
- Genre: Mean = 57.73, Std = 30.03

Outlier Detection:
- Mood Outliers: 10
- Genre Outliers: 2

Statistical Test Results:

1. Independent T-Test (Before Removing Outliers)
   - t-statistic: 10.351
   - p-value: 0.0000
   - Result: Statistically significant difference in means

2. Bootstrap Confidence Interval (Before Removing Outliers)
   - 95% CI for mean diff: [5.295, 7.781]

3. Bootstrap Confidence Interval (After Removing Outliers)
   - 95% CI for mean diff: [5.561, 7.994]

Interpretation:
- Mood playlists showed significantly higher average popularity scores than genre playlists.
- The effect is robust across both classical t-tests and non-parametric bootstrapping.
- Outliers were inspected and removed; conclusions remained consistent.
- No evident bias in playlist size distribution or track count per group.

Conclusion:
âœ… Mood-based playlists perform better than genre-based playlists in terms of user engagement (popularity score).
